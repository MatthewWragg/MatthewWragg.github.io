    content: `<p>Hello! After a long time in the making, I am delighted to introduce my new blog! I hope to share research findings, personal updates, events, and lots of other research-related things. My main goal with this blog is to help make the research process as accessible and inclusive as possible, and to give some insights into the world of digital health research.</p>
    <p>I've had a few ideas for some regular posts, including updates from my fellowship with the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, opportunities to take part in research studies, and events organised by LEAP.</p>
    <p>I would also love to create posts sharing your personal stories, particularly around taking part in research and accessing research findings. If you have anything you would like to share or any topics you would like me to cover, please get in touch!</p>`
