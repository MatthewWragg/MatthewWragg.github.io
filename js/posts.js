I hope to share research findings, personal updates, events, and lots of other research-related things. One of my main goals with this blog is to help make research as accessible and inclusive as possible, particularly by sharing research findings and supporting patient and public involvement and engagement.</p>
    <p>I've had a few ideas for some regular posts, including updates from my fellowship work with the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, opportunities to take part in research studies, and events organised by LEAP.</p>
    <p>I would also love to create posts sharing your personal stories, particularly around taking part in research and accessing research findings. If you have anything you would like to share or any other topics you would like me to cover, please get in touch!</p>`
