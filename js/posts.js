    <p>I've had a few ideas for some regular posts, including updates from my fellowship work with the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, opportunities to take part in research studies, and events organised by LEAP.</p>
    <p>I would also love to create posts sharing your personal stories, particularly around taking part in research and accessing research findings. If you have anything you would like to share or any other topics you would like me to cover, please get in touch!</p>`

    I thought I would share some exciting updates from my axSpA research project over the last couple of weeks. Hope you enjoy!<br>

    <h3>Patient engagement event</h3>
    
    Last weekend, we ran another research patient engagement event at the University of Bath. It was a chance for people living with axSpA to meet with academic researchers and clinicians, to discuss current and future research at university, and to explore ways to get involved with and guide research studies. Despite the heatwave, we had around 40 attendees which was fantastic!</p>

    <p>We started the day with an insightful panel discussion with two people living with axSpA, who talked about their diagnosis journeys, self-management practices, and how axSpA has affected their lives. We then presented the current research projects happening at the university, and invited attendees to take part in a series of workshops run by the researchers. I had the pleasure of running two of these workshops based on my fellowship research, looking at what information people record about their health outside of the clinic, and how this could be used during appointments to help guide shared decision-making and personalised care.</p>

    <p>A huge thank you to those that took part in any of the workshops, and to all of the organisers and researchers. I know I speak for all of the other researchers when I say that discussions like those are absolutely invaluable for us, and are crucial for designing research that reflects the needs and perspectives of people with lived experience. If you attended these sessions, I hope they were useful for you and gave you some insights into the research happening at the RUH and the university. We will be running more of these events in the future, so if you're considering attending - please do!</p>

    <h3>axSpA research at the RUH</h3>

    <p>I'm delighted to share that we have received favourable ethical opinion from the NHS ethics committee for our study at the RUH! We will be recruiting participants through the RUH until the end of October 2025, so if you have an appointment at the RUH for your axSpA care during this time, a member of your care team may be in touch to discuss whether you might like to take part. We have also submitted an application for NIHR Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) funding, which would allow us to continue our axSpA research with the RUH for another 2.5 years.</p>

    <p>Another huge thank you to the BIRD patient panel who provided lots of insightful feedback on our study plans and documents. Being a part of a research panel is a great way to get involved in research without having to participate in studies, and helps us to design more accessible, inclusive, and meaningful research. If you would like to know more about participating in the BIRD patient panel, please get in touch with Mel at <a href="mailto:ppe@birdbath.org.uk">ppe@birdbath.org.uk</a>.</p>

    excerpt: "Exciting news from LEAP today - we have just announced our Community Innovator Scheme!",
    content: `<p>Hi everyone, I'm really excited to share that LEAP have just announced the launch of the <a href="https://leap-hub.ac.uk/leap-digital-health-community-innovators/">Digital Health Community Innovator Scheme!</a><br><br>

    Is there a health challenge that you have experienced or that you see in your community that you think could be solved using digital technology? If so, we want to work with you to help you turn your ideas and insights into impactful digital health research. The community innovator scheme is designed for people with real-world experience of health and care in the community, who want to make a difference and explore digital ways to improve lives. You don't need research or technical skills, just a problem or opportunity you care about and a passion for making things better.<br><br>

    If you have any questions, there's lots more info on the <a href="https://leap-hub.ac.uk/leap-digital-health-community-innovators/">LEAP website</a> and there will be two online information sessions on <a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/leapdigitalhealthhub/1828015"> Tuesday 16th</a> and <a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/leapdigitalhealthhub/1828257"> Friday 19th</a> September 2025.

    Last Friday, we held the LEAP Community Sandpit at the fantastic Trinity Community Arts Centre in Bristol.

    Despite the torrential rain, we were joined by an incredible group of attendees and 9 passionate Community Innovators who shared their challenges and bold ideas. Each Innovator had just 5 minutes to pitch their challenge, refined in collaboration with LEAP researchers to highlight opportunities for impact.

    After the presentations, attendees worked together at challenge tables, brainstorming solutions and scoping projects with a view to applying for £10,000 seedcorn funding for a research and innovation project.

    The energy, creativity, and bravery in the room were truly impressive. Thank you to everyone who contributed ideas, brought their own lived experience, and embraced the spirit of innovation.

    On a personal note, I'm so proud to be a part of our community innovator scheme. It's amazing to see so many members of the community get involved in research and share their lived experiences. I'm so exicted to work with them on shaping these projects.

    Huge thanks to all who made this happen, and to everyone who braved the weather to be part of it!
